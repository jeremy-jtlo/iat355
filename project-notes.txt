Notes from Feb 19 Class:

-Figure out what's already in place in Burnaby
	-This tells us more about the meaning of incoming building permits
	-Also means we may have to figure out maps

-Check Population census
	-Figure out more about the population: age, income, ethnicity, career

-Drive the visualization with questions
	-"What's getting built? What exists already?"
	-"Is there a relationship between our buildings and the population?"
		-Hunt for CORRELATIONS

-If we hunt for correlations, map coordinates may not be needed
	-Correlations can be represented by graphs fairly easily, esp. 2D

-Building permits can be shown as a line chart/histogram. What permits are spiking? When?
	-Scatterplots can be introduced when we start comparing other dimensions
		-Population, taxes, subsidies

-"Personas": Help us figure out who's going to be asking the questions we're trying to answer
	-Us young dudes: Can we ever afford a house in Greater Vancouver?
		-Young, 20-27
		-Post-secondary education
		-$40,000 - $65,000 CAD annually for junior positions
	-Realtors/investors: What's the market been doing? Where will it go?
		-Looking to put money in maybe not just 1 property
		-Expanded view to more than just townhouses, duplexes, and condos
		-Perhaps looking for commercial or wider-scale development
