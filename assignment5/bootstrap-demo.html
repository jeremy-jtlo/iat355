                We don't want to set these clouds on fire. Almost everything is going to happen for you automatically - you don't have to spend any time working or worrying. Everything's not great in life, but we can still find beauty in it. Let's give him a friend too. Everybody needs a friend. Absolutely no pressure. You are just a whisper floating across a mountain.

                Happy painting, God bless. Little trees and bushes grow however makes them happy. That's a crooked tree. We'll send him to Washington. -->
